# automated-linux-server-hardening-toolkit

Project Overview

The Automated Linux Server Hardening Toolkit is designed to automate common Linux hardening tasks in a safe, repeatable, and auditable way.
It demonstrates skills in Bash scripting, Ansible automation, and system security verification, making it ideal for portfolio showcase.
Goals

    Automate common hardening tasks so they are reproducible and auditable.
    Be idempotent and safe to run on a test system (WSL/VM/cloud).
    Produce logs and a verification checklist to demonstrate results.

Features / Deliverables

    Bash scripts for quick local runs (idempotent)
    Ansible role/playbook for production-style automation
    Verification scripts that check and report compliance for each rule

Minimal Requirements

    Linux machine (WSL Ubuntu is fine, or small cloud VM)
    Bash, Ansible (for automation)
    Python 3 (for verification/reporting)
